# ConnectFour

My overall objective was to create a client-side functional web game app designed after the classic board game Connect Fourâ„¢. 
To accomplish this, I wrote algorithms that would check for winning board states and, in single-player mode, determine where the CPU next move. 

In the future I plan to revist this project and implement a much smarter AI solution utilizing the Tree data structure.
